# Improve Kanban Board UI and UX – Full Task Board Redesign Prompt

You are working with a Kanban task board UI. The current version displays tasks across columns like `New`, `In Progress`, `Blocked`, and `Completed`. It includes task cards, avatars, deadlines, filters, sorting, and basic drag-and-drop functionality.

However, the current version is missing several critical UX elements and polish details. Please implement the following **exact improvements**:

---

## 1. Enable Drag Feedback & Animation (Highest Priority)

- When dragging a task over a column, existing tasks should **shift downward to make space** for the incoming card.
- Show a **placeholder gap** between cards during drag.
- Animate task movement smoothly.
- Add **visual highlighting** (e.g., subtle border or background tint) on the column being hovered.
- Use `@dnd-kit/sortable` or `react-beautiful-dnd` with smooth spring animation for interactions.

---

## 2. Improve Column Width & Layout

- Ensure columns have a **minimum width** (e.g. `min-w-[260px]`) for visual readability.
- Allow horizontal scrolling when there are more columns than fit in the viewport.
- Make sure cards are fully visible on all screen sizes.

---

## 3. Improve Column Headers (Labels & Count)

- Move task count to the right of the column title like this:  
  `New (3)` instead of just `3` in a separate bubble.
- Reduce visual weight of the count (e.g., gray-400).
- Make sure column headers are clearly readable at a glance.

---

## 4. Enhance Card Hover Interaction

- When hovering a card:
  - Elevate it slightly (`hover:shadow-md`)
  - Optionally show quick actions or drag handle
- Add a clear hover state for the card container itself (border, background, or opacity change).

---

## 5. Improve "+ Add Task" Button

- Current button is visually weak and looks like a secondary control.
- Style it as a **primary button** using shadcn/ui’s `variant="default"`.
- Add icon + text:  
  `+ Add Task`

---

## 6. Improve Sort/Filter Interactions

- When filters are applied, show a **badge indicator** next to the Filter button (e.g. "Filters ●").
- Save sort/filter state to localStorage or URL params so the user doesn't lose it on reload.
- Consider animating dropdown open/close for Filter and Sort controls.

---

## 7. Avatar Stack Improvement

- Limit visible avatars to 2 per card.
- If more than 2 assignees/watchers are present, show a grouped `+N` avatar (e.g. `+2`).
- Tooltip should show names on hover.

---

## 8. Mobile Responsiveness

- Ensure the board layout is responsive:
  - Columns should scroll horizontally (`overflow-x-auto`)
  - Filters and sort should collapse into a dropdown menu on small viewports
- Test drag behavior on touch devices (if library supports it)

---

## 9. Inline Status Change (Optional, Bonus)

- Allow status dropdown directly on each card (e.g. inside `...` menu).
- Update task status in memory immediately.
- Show success or error toast based on update result.

---

## 10. Toast Messages for Status Updates

- On successful drag, status dropdown, or modal update:
  - Show success toast: `"Task status updated"`
- On failure:
  - Show error toast: `"Failed to update task status"`
- Use top-right positioning and auto-dismiss after 3 seconds

---

## Final Notes

- Stick to **Montserrat font** and **dark mode** using shadcn/ui
- Keep consistent spacing and visual rhythm across the board
- Make sure everything updates in real-time in memory (no database persistence needed)

You are not done until:
- Tasks shift down during drag
- Columns are readable and responsive
- Status can be changed via drag or dropdown
- Cards give feedback on hover
- Toast messages are working
