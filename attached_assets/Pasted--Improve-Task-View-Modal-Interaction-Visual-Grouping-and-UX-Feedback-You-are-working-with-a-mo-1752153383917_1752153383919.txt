# Improve Task View Modal – Interaction, Visual Grouping, and UX Feedback

You are working with a modal that displays detailed task information. The current version includes: task title, description, status buttons, assignee, priority, deadline, and creator info.

The layout is clean, but it lacks clear interaction feedback and visual clarity in some areas. Please implement the following improvements:

---

## 1. Enable Status Change Feedback

- When a user selects a new status (e.g. In Progress, Completed):
  - Show a success toast or checkmark indicator
  - Add a temporary loading indicator (spinner or disabled state) while saving
  - Visually highlight the selected status (e.g. filled button, color change)

---

## 2. Enhance Priority Visibility

- Move "Priority" closer to the Deadline section (since both relate to urgency)
- Style the priority value using a **color-coded badge**:
  - Low → green
  - Medium → yellow
  - High → red
- Optional: use icons or arrows to reinforce meaning

---

## 3. Improve Visual Grouping of Sections

- Add clear section dividers or background containers to separate:
  - Content area (title, description)
  - Metadata (assignee, creator, deadline)
  - Status controls
- Use consistent vertical spacing and muted section labels

---

## 4. Improve Top-Right Action Icons

- The pencil (edit) icon in the top-right is hard to understand
  - Add a tooltip: `Edit task`
  - Optional: move edit into a sticky footer as a button ("Edit Task")

- Keep the Close (`X`) icon, but test making it slightly larger or placing it inside the modal header

---

## 5. Improve Date Readability

- Format dates like `Jul 11, 2025` instead of `7/11/2025` for clarity
- For “Created by,” move timestamp to tooltip or display in muted color

---

## 6. Enable Scroll for Long Tasks

- If task content grows vertically, allow scrolling inside the modal
- Fix the task title + status row so it stays visible while scrolling

---

## Summary

You must improve the Task Modal to:
- Provide **feedback** when changing status
- Visually **group sections** more clearly
- Make priority and urgency more **prominent**
- Clarify and improve **action buttons**
- Handle longer content cleanly with scroll

All of this should follow existing UI style (shadcn/ui, dark mode, Montserrat font).
