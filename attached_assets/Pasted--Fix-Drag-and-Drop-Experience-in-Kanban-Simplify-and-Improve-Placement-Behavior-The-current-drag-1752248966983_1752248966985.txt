# Fix Drag-and-Drop Experience in Kanban – Simplify and Improve Placement Behavior

The current drag-and-drop interaction is too complex and not behaving as expected. Here's what I need you to fix immediately:

## What's Wrong Now:

1. **Overuse of placeholders and visual noise**
   - "⬇ Drop here ⬇" messages and pulsing effects are distracting
   - Placeholder appears even when not useful (e.g. dragging over non-drop areas)

2. **Unrealistic column feedback**
   - Highlighted borders and corner badges add noise but don’t help me predict actual drop position

3. **Cards don’t shift smoothly**
   - When dragging over a populated column, existing tasks should **shift down** to make room
   - Currently, the placeholder exists **between** cards, but cards don’t animate away properly

---

## What I Want Instead:

### 1. Smooth Card Shifting (Like Trello/Jira)
- When I drag a task into a column:
  - Other tasks should **move downward** to make space
  - The space where the task will land should be **clearly visible**
  - Do NOT show big messages like "Drop here" — just use spacing and animation

### 2. Remove Flashy Placeholders
- Get rid of pulsing arrows, glowing messages, and overly styled overlays
- Drop target should be **simple and obvious**:
  - Empty column? Show just a dashed border
  - Hovering over middle of a column? Push tasks to show spacing
  - Don't show large labels unless absolutely necessary

### 3. Clean Column Hover Feedback
- Highlight the column **lightly**, not with heavy color or dashed outlines
- You may use a subtle background or box shadow on hover

---

## Technical Instructions:

- Use `react-beautiful-dnd` or `@dnd-kit/sortable` with proper vertical sorting
- Animate spacing using CSS transition (e.g., `transition-all`, `duration-150`)
- When hovering between two tasks, the placeholder should push the cards and indicate drop location
- Don’t allow overlapping visual layers like blue rings, glowing icons, etc.

---

## Summary:

Clean up the drag interaction so it behaves like Trello or Jira:
- Tasks shift down in real time
- Drop position is visible through spacing, not labels
- Reduce animation noise
- Show only subtle visual hints

Do not come back with flashy UI. Just make it **functional, simple, and predictable**.
